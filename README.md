# Homepage
This is the homepage for my homelab website (https://broomfieldhomelab.net)
This code is mainly for Josh, but I will eventually upload this to my main Github account.

Prerequisites 
You'll need Git and Node.js (which comes with NPM) installed.

node@v16.4.2 or higher
npm@7.18.1 or higher
git@2.30.1 or higher
Also, you can use Yarn instead of NPM

yarn@v1.22.10 or higher

How To Use 
From your command line, first clone the repo:

# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/STA-MaxBroomfield/Homepage

# Move into the repository
$ cd Homepage

# Remove the current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
After that, you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn.

Using NPM: Simply run the below commands.

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the development server
$ npm start
